In this article, traffic restrictions and their subsequent impact on emissions and air quality are discussed. The restrictions were applied in Barcelona, Spain to better the air quality of the city. 
These restrictions include a Low Emission Zone that applies to the whole city and keeps high-pollution vehicles out. Although the article tells how the restrictions helped air quality a little, the results were unsatisfactory compared to the level they were going for. 
The experts recommend further regulations. This article shows how basic restrictions may sound nice on paper and help in a minor way. However
to make true change happen, drastic measures must be taken to curtail air pollution.
